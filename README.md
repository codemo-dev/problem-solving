# 🧠 JavaScript Problem Solving Lab

A continuously growing repository dedicated to mastering **problem solving**,  
**algorithms**, and **core JavaScript concepts** through consistent practice.

---

## 🚀 About This Repository
This repository serves as a personal lab for:
- Developing strong logical thinking
- Practicing clean and efficient JavaScript
- Solving algorithmic and logic-based challenges
- Building discipline through continuous problem solving

New problems are added regularly as part of an ongoing learning journey.

---

## 🗂 Repository Structure
Solutions are organized by topic to keep the repository clean, readable, and scalable:



/basics
/conditionals
/loops
/arrays
/strings
/functions
/objects
/algorithms
/data-structures


Each file represents an **independent solution** to a single problem.

---

## ▶️ Running the Code
Each solution is written in **pure JavaScript**.

The output is displayed using `console.log` for testing and verification purposes.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen problem-solving skills
- Improve algorithmic thinking
- Write readable and maintainable JavaScript
- Build a solid foundation for technical interviews
- Track long-term learning progress

---

## 🧩 Guidelines
- Pure JavaScript only
- No browser or DOM usage
- Focus on logic, not UI
- Clear naming and structure
- One problem per file

---

## 📈 Progress & Growth
This repository is updated frequently with new challenges as part of daily practice and continuous improvement.
